        <p>Thanks for choosing Sites To Go! These terms set clear expectations and protect both of us. We've written
            them in plain language - if anything is unclear, just reach out at <a

        <p>By engaging our services, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms").</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>
        <p>Sites To Go creates simple, professional one-page websites for local businesses. Your package includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Custom one-page website design and development</li>
            <li>Website hosting at no ongoing cost to you</li>
            <li>Domain connection assistance (you purchase the domain separately)</li>
            <li>Revision rounds as outlined in your chosen package (Starter: 1 round, Plus: 2 rounds)</li>
            <li>Basic template Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Service Focus</h2>
        <p>We specialize in simple, effective one-page websites that work great for local businesses. To maintain
            quality and keep pricing affordable, we focus specifically on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-page website layouts (not multi-page sites with complex navigation)</li>
            <li>Clean presentation of your business information (not e-commerce, membership systems, or user login
                areas)</li>
            <li>Professional static websites using proven design patterns (not custom programming or advanced
                integrations)</li>
            <li>Easy-to-maintain sites (not blogs, forums, or content management systems)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For features outside this scope, we're happy to refer you to specialists who can better serve those needs.
            Domain name registration is handled separately by you, and we'll guide you through the simple setup process.
        </p>

        <h2>Pricing and Payment</h2>
        <p>Our pricing is straightforward:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One-time payment for website creation (no monthly subscription fees to us)</li>
            <li>50% deposit required before we begin work</li>
            <li>50% final payment due before website launch</li>
            <li>Website hosting is included at no ongoing cost</li>
            <li>Additional work beyond the agreed scope will be quoted separately before we proceed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Payment is due within 7 days of invoice. Your website will not be hosted or made live until final payment is
            received in full.</p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>We aim to complete most websites within 7-14 days from our initial consultation. The actual timeline depends
            on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How quickly you provide required content and feedback</li>
            <li>Current project workload</li>
            <li>Complexity of your requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we work to meet estimated timelines, we cannot guarantee specific completion dates due to factors
            outside our control.</p>

        <h2>Revisions</h2>
        <p>Revision rounds are included in your package to refine the design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starter package: 1 round of revisions</li>
            <li>Plus package: 2 rounds of revisions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A revision round consists of up to 10 related feedback points submitted together (e.g., text changes, image
            swaps, layout tweaks, color adjustments). Requests for major structural changes, additional sections, or
            complex additions beyond the original scope will be quoted separately.</p>
        <p>Additional revision rounds can be purchased for $125 each if needed.</p>

        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>To ensure a smooth project, you are responsible for providing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about your business and the services you provide (we'll format and present this
                professionally)</li>
            <li>Business logo and branding materials</li>
            <li>Photos and images you want included</li>
            <li>Accurate business information and contact details</li>
            <li>Timely feedback during the revision process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You confirm that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have the right to use all materials provided to us</li>
            <li>Your content does not violate any laws or third-party rights</li>
            <li>You will not provide content that is illegal, defamatory, harmful, or promotes hate, violence, or
                discrimination</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to refuse to publish content that violates these standards.</p>

        <h2>Ownership and Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Upon full payment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You own your domain name (purchased and managed separately by you)</li>
            <li>You own all website files and can request a complete copy at any time</li>
            <li>You have full rights to use, modify, or move your website</li>
            <li>We retain the right to use your website in our portfolio and marketing materials (unless you request
                otherwise)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use professional design frameworks and code components across projects to maintain quality and
            affordability. Your specific content, branding, and website customization are unique to you and fully yours.
        </p>

        <h2>Website Hosting</h2>
        <p>Hosting is included with your website at no ongoing cost to you. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We manage technical hosting setup, deployment, and server maintenance</li>
            <li>Our hosting infrastructure targets high reliability (typically 99.9% uptime)</li>
            <li>We are not liable for downtime caused by third-party hosting providers, internet outages, platform
                changes, or events outside our reasonable control</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free availability, as no hosting service can</li>
            <li>Your website is built as a portable static site and is not locked into a proprietary system</li>
            <li>You retain full ownership of your website files and may request a copy at any time</li>
            <li>You are free to move your website to another hosting provider at any time</li>
            <li>If our hosting structure changes in the future, we will provide at least 30 days' notice, supply your
                website files, and offer reasonable transfer assistance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Your website may use third-party services such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact form services (e.g., Web3Forms)</li>
            <li>Google Maps for location embedding</li>
            <li>Analytics tools (if included in your package)</li>
            <li>Any integrations you specifically request (booking systems, chat widgets, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These services are provided by third parties and are subject to their own terms and availability. We are not
            responsible for changes, outages, or discontinuation of third-party services, though we will make reasonable
            efforts to notify you and suggest alternatives if issues arise.</p>

        <h2>Post-Launch Updates</h2>
        <p>After your website launches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minor updates (text changes, image swaps, contact detail updates) are charged at an hourly rate</li>
            <li>There is no obligation for ongoing updates or maintenance</li>
            <li>Additional sections, features, or pages can be added - pricing available upon request</li>
            <li>We'll provide a quote before starting any post-launch work</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Fit</h2>
        <p>We specialize in simple, effective one-page websites. This focus allows us to deliver quality results quickly
            and affordably.</p>
        <p>If your project needs features outside our one-page website focus (such as e-commerce, complex multi-page
            structures, or custom applications), we'll let you know upfront and can recommend specialists who focus on
            those services.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
        <p>If you cancel a project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before work begins: Full refund of deposit</li>
            <li>After work has commenced: Deposit is non-refundable. Work completed to date may be billed at our
                standard hourly rate, and you will receive all work-in-progress files</li>
            <li>After final payment and website launch: No refund, but you receive all website files and retain full
                ownership</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we cancel the project due to non-payment, unavailability of required information, or other issues on your
            end, the same refund policy applies.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>We're committed to delivering quality work and supporting your online presence. However, to maintain
            affordable pricing and operate as a small business, the following limitations apply:</p>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by Australian law:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Our total liability is limited to the total amount you paid for our services</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee specific business results, website traffic, search engine rankings, or sales</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for content you provide, third-party services, or issues arising from your use of
                the website after delivery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence,
            fraud, or any liability that cannot be excluded by Australian law.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law and Disputes</h2>

            can be sorted out through friendly communication.</p>

            post the updated version on this page with a new "Last updated" date. Continued use of our services after
            changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
